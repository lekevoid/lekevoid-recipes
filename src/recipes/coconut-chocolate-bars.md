1. If coconut is not already powdered, process the coconut in the blender.
2. Melt the coconut oil.
3. Mix together the powdered coconut, coconut oil, honey, almond extract, and 2 tbsp of the coconut milk.
4. Pour the mix into a flat container (rectangular is recommended, and you might want to line it up with parchment or wax paper). Flatten as much as possible with a spoon, ramekin etc. Put into the freezer to chill.
5. Melt the chocolate on low heat with the rest of the coconut milk.
6. Once the chocolate is melted, pour it on top of the coconut mix.
7. Put back in the freezer to chill for at least an hour.
8. Cut down to bite-size pieces.
9. And as aaaalways, eeeeeeenjoyyy !!!
