  1. Make rice directly in the chicken stock

  2. In a very large pan, start browning the onions in butter.

  3. Add the garlic and finish browning the onions.

  4. Drain the beans and add them to the onion. Let simmer on medium-high heat to let some liquid evaporate.

  5. Add the coconut milk, thyme and clove. Let flavors mix.

  6. Add the cooked rice. It doesn't matter if the rice is slightly undercooked, it'll finish cooking in the milk.

  7. Serve hot. Recommended : serve with fresh cilantro or cilantro-infused oil on top.
