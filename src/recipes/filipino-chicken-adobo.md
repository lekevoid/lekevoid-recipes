1. M﻿arinate the chicken in the soy sauce, rice vinegar and peppercorns, in the fridge, at least 20 minutes and preferably overnight.
2. Get chicken out of marinade. Let drip (or pat dry). Reserve the marinade.
3. Sear chicken in a bit of oil on high heat, 2 minutes per side, until browned. It doesn't need to be cooked through. Set aside.
4. I﻿n the same pan, cook the onions in a bit more oil. Add garlic. Cook until garlic is brown. Onion doesn't have to be brown.
5. P﻿our the marinade in the pan. Deglaze any brown residue. Add brown sugar and bay leaves. Simmer on medium heat for 4 minutes.
6. Put the chicken back in the pan. Cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by about half.
7. I﻿f necessary, remove chicken to continue cooking and thickening the sauce. If necessary, add some xanthane gum.
8. S﻿erve on top of a mix of half-jasmine, half-basmati rice.
