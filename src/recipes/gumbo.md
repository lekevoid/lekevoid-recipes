### M﻿ake the Roux

C﻿ombine flour and oil in a pot. Simmer on medium heat for at least 30-40 minutes. Stir constantly, do not let it stick or burn ! It'll smell a bit off, it's fine, trust me.

### P﻿rep the ingredients

1. Sear the sausages and the chicken, just to give them color. Set aside.
2. C﻿ook the onions until transluscent. Set aside.
3. P﻿rep and set aside all the other veggies, together.

### A﻿ssemble

1. W﻿hen the roux is ready, pus everything, the roux, veggies, meat and spices, into the chicken broth.
2. S﻿immer for frankly as long as possible so the flavors mix. Adjust water to taste.
