In batches, process all ingredients in blender and add to a big pot.

Heat up and let simmer so the flavors combine, at least an hour.

Add vinegar as needed if the sauce is too thick. It should be able to comfortably pass through the guzzle of whatever bottle you'll be using.

When everything seems pretty homogenous, store as needed.
