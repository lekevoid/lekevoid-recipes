### M﻿ake the Marinade

T﻿his starts with a dry rub. Roll each meat piece in a plate containing cajun spice, to coat the piece, like you would do when breading. Then set aside in a big bowl. Use as much spice as you need. The 10 tbsp is just an estimate. 

F﻿or the wet part, mix the lime juice and sugar together. What we're aiming for is a ratio that, if you were to add water, would produce a lemonade that you'd personally find tasty. Adjust the lime/sugar ratio accordingly.

Throw whatever leftover spices you have in the big bowl with the meat, add the "lemonade", and massage to spread all over.
