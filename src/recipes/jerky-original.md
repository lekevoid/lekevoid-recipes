  ## Make the marinade


  Just put together all the ingredients (except the meat of course) in a mason jar. This can be done in advance.


  ## Prep the meat


  Two ways to make meat easier to cut (assuming we're starting with a French roast cut) :


  * Get frozen meat out of the freezer and let it thaw for about 24 hours. The meat will still feel very firm to the touch, but it will actually be the perfect hardness to cut.

    \- OR -
  * Put the fresh meat in the freezer for 1-2 hours.


  ## Cut the meat


  Make slices, about 1/16 inches or 2 mm thick, as consistent as possible. Cut against the grain.


  ## Marinade the meat


  Dip each piece of meat in the marinade and then put them in a "marinating vessel" (a sous-vide bag works wonders, but a big bowl covered in plastic wrap is totally fine).


  When all the meat has been put aside, pour the rest of the marinade into the marinating vessel. Massage gently to get the sauce into the nooks & crannies. Rinse the jar with a bit of water to get as much of the sauce as possible (diluting isn't a bad thing, it may be too salty otherwise).


  Put the marinating vessel into the fridge overnight and for up to 48 hours.


  ## Dry the meat


  Preheat the over at **350°F**.


  Put the meat on a cooking rack (the tighter the mesh the better, helps prevent the meat from sticking). Pieces shouldn't get over each other, but they can touch lightly, they'll shrink as they dry.


  Put the meat into the heated oven.


  Let cook for 2-3 minutes, and then immediately switch the oven to **convect bake mode at 150°F**.


  Let dry for up to 4 hours. Flip the pieces over after an hour or two.


  Check the doneness and texture every hour or so. Remove the thinner slices earlier and let the thicker ones cook longer.


  ## Store the meat


  Put the jerky in a closed jar or container with a silica sachet to absorb moisture.


  From experience, jerky stores well on the counter for a week or two but then develop mold. Storing in the fridge extends that time (we don't know by how much, we always eat it before it goes bad).
notes: Gigi finds this recipe a bit too salty but still addictive.
