notes: "2022-12-23 : For the pepper, I used white only. I want to try a mix of
  white, black and pink. Also I used about 1/3 freshly ground, and the rest
  pre-bought powder. Making it totally fresh ground might be ideal taste-wise,
  but I also want to make sure it doesn't create too many big particles that
  make it not fun to chew. To be tested."
