P﻿ut the pork chops in a glass container for the oven without overlapping.

S﻿lice the apples and onion, making large but medium-thickness slices (too thin will mush, too thick won't bleed taste). Lay them on top of the chops, arranged evenly.

M﻿ix the apple juice with the garlic and mustard and pour on top. If needed, add some apple juice, enough to cover the chops and touch the fruits.

C﻿over the container with aluminum foil and put in the oven at low-ish temperature, 250 to 300°F
